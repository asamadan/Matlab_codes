# HMM-Classification
HMM training, testing | HMM/maximum likelihood classification

This repository contains a collection of matlab codes to train and test/validate a multi-class HMM classifier 
based on maximum-likelihood classification. 

% This function require Kevin Murphy's MATLAB HMM package:

%               https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm.html

% to train HMMs (EM algorithm) and exectue maximum likelihood
% classification (forward algorithm)

% Here, the implementation of HMM classification is meant for continuous
observations e.g., physical  activities (human movements), or physiological
activities (e.g., gesture-specific forearm EMG signals)
this classification code (fully or partially) has been used in:
